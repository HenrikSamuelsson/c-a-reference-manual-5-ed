<big>Exercise 2.1</big>  

Which of the following are lexical tokens?  

 - keywords  
 - comments  
 - whitespace  
 - hexadecimal constants  
 - trigraphs  
 - wide string constants  
 - parentheses  

<big>Solution</big>  
The keywords, identifiers, constants, string literals, and operators are examples of tokens. Punctuation characters and various types of parentheses are also tokens.  

This means that the following are lexical tokens:  

- keywords 
- hexadecimal constants  
- wide string constants  
- parentheses  

Comments and whitespace are not lexical tokens.  

Trigraphs are replaced by their single-character equivalent before any other processing.
