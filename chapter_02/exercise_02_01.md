##Exercise 2.1  

Which of the following are lexical tokens?  

 - keywords  
 - comments  
 - whitespace  
 - hexadecimal constants  
 - trigraphs  
 - wide string constants  
 - parentheses  

##Solution  

The keywords, identifiers, constants, string literals, and operators are examples of tokens. Punctuation characters and various types of parentheses are also tokens.  

This means that the following are lexical tokens:  

- keywords 
- hexadecimal constants  
- wide string constants  
- parentheses  

Comments and whitespace are not lexical tokens.  

Trigraphs are replaced by their single-character equivalent before any other processing.
